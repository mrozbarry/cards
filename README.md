# Cards

This project is a complete re-write of another project I have worked on called [cardular](https://github.com/mrozbarry/cardular).  I am not using that code or using it as reference: this is a brand new implementation.

# Running locally

```
git clone git@github.com:rumblex/nodeknockout2016-cards.git
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
yarn dev
```

# Thanks
